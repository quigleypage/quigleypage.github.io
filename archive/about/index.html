        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p class="lead">Here's a bit about me.</p>
        <p align="left">My name is Kevin Quigley and I am currently working as a CS Technology Analyst at Wiley (John Wiley and Sons, Inc). In this role, I serve as the bridge between the business users and the development teams by communicating with both groups to enable productivity, optimization, and compromise.<br><br>In May 2016, I received my Bachelor of Engineering with Honor in Computer Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. While at Stevens, I was an active leader in many organizations including the Stevens Game Development Club, Off Center Comedy, the Student Government Association, and Khoda: the Senior Honor Society. During my sophomore year of college, I created a software company which focused on game development and would ultimately produce my capstone design project: a mobile application which was intended to aid environmental data collection and analysis. To provide a healthy contrast to my engineering activities, my improv comedy team claimed a 4th Place victory at the College Improv Tournament 9 Nationals, where we became the East Super Regional Champions. Similarly, my performing arts interest also landed me a spot as a baritone singer in the President's Ensemble a'capella group.<br><br>Prior to college, I attended the Marine Academy of Technology and Environmental Science in Manahawkin, New Jersey where I developed a strong background in STEM areas including environmental science, data analysis, and robotics. Focused primarily on the MATE ROV competiton, my underwater robots were able to succeed at regionals and allow me the opportunity to attend the international competitions at the University of Hawaii at Hilo and later at the NASA Neutral Bouyancy Lab in Houston, Texas. Outside of school, I served as the Senior Patrol leader for BSA NJ JSC Troop 156 and later the Assistant Senior Patrol Leader for Troop 56, where I was able to earn my Eagle Scout rank. Moreover, I participated in Lacey Township High School's Spring musical for 3 years, culiminating with my senior year performance as "The Beast" in Disney's Beauty and the Beast.<br><br>Since I started with Wiley in October 2016, I have enjoyed the opportunity to develop experience in a technical yet collaborative business role. While I continue to pursue the wisdom that Wiley has to offer, I look forward to whatever may lie ahead.</p>
